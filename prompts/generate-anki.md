The course is given by the prompt. If not, you should use the latest course under `labs/` .

Basic on `labs/<course>.md`, create corresponding `<course>.mdanki.md` with author `davidpangsw`. See README.md for more information. The format of mdanki file is given in `mdanki/README.md`. One lab corresponds to one card. One course corresponds to one deck.


Only include the steps and forget about other parts like prerequisites. Each lab should be like "Do something (`<Shortcut Key>`)" where "do something doesn't hint the key to be pressed. If the card contains wording like "Press again" "Press Escape", remove these wording and write the key in a bracket instead, because these wordings hint about the key. The key, as answer, should only be in the bracket.  For example, "Press again to cancel" should become "Cancel (Press again)"



Card Front is the lab steps WITHOUT the bracketed shortcut, that there is no hint to know that key. Card Back is the lab steps WITH the bracketed shortcut.
