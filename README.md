This is a project for me to internalize useful shortcuts under different situations.

# Brainstorming
- Generally speaking, shortcut is an action that brings the computer state to another state:
    - Action could be keyboard keys, gesture, ... It should be fast to perform.
    - the source state usually is just a "normal state" but not guaranteed. It also includes the App context.
    - The destination state is what we usually aim for


- Nobody can memorize all shortcuts, we have to prioritize. To prioritize, we need "measures"
  - Is the shortcut commonly used?
  - Is the shortcut commonly used generally? Or just under some situations?
  - Is the shortcut commonly mis-performed, that we have to revert it back?
  - Is the shortcut important?

- After prioritizing, we need ways to internalize them:
  - Organize related shortcut in a series that cycle back to original state
  - The states, actions and results should be observed directly, not in a text that describe them.
  - Make use of the science of flashcards (spaced repetition, active recall, etc.), if possible.
